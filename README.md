## Network Components

### Host Roles
Hosts (also called end devices) are computers or devices connected to a network and assigned an IP address to enable communication.

Clients are hosts that request services, like viewing web pages or emails.

Servers are hosts that provide services (e.g., web or email) to clients using specialized server software.

### Peer-to-Peer Networks
In peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, devices can act as both clients and servers.

Common in homes/small offices for tasks like file and printer sharing.

Advantages: Easy to set up, less complex, lower cost.

Disadvantages: No centralized control, less security, not scalable, and can reduce performance.

### End Devices
End devices are either the source or destination of data on a network.

Each device has a unique address to identify it for communication.

Data travels from one end device to another through a network.

### Intermediary Devices
These connect end devices and manage data traffic across the network.

Examples: Routers, Switches, Firewalls, Wireless Routers.

Functions include: directing data paths, error notification, signal regeneration, prioritization, and enforcing security.

### Network Media
Network media are the physical or wireless pathways over which data travels.

Three main types:

Copper cables – electrical signals.

Fiber-optic cables – light pulses.

Wireless – electromagnetic waves.

Selection criteria: Distance, environment, data amount/speed, and cost.


1.2.6 Review Questions
Hosts are the devices that directly participate in network communication.

Fiber-optic cables use pulses of light to transmit data.

Routers and switches are examples of intermediary devices.
